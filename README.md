📘 C Programming Projects
This repository contains a collection of my C programming projects — created to:

Deepen my understanding of computer science fundamentals

Strengthen my coding and debugging skills

Build a meaningful and evolving developer portfolio

🧮 Project 1: Simple Calculator with Result Memory
A basic console calculator written in C that supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations:

➕ Addition  ➖ Subtraction  ✖️ Multiplication  ➗ Division

🔑 Key Features
✅ Stores results in a fixed-size array (maximum of 10 values)

🚫 Automatically shuts down and displays results once memory is full

🗑️ Allows deletion of specific results, with automatic shifting of remaining values

⚠️ Known Limitations & Planned Improvements
🎨 The current layout and user interface are minimal and unpolished and you can't reuse the results

🧩 The implementation is monolithic – all logic is handled in one place
➤ Planned refactor into modular functions to improve:

Code readability

Maintainability

User experience

📌 More projects and improvements are planed
